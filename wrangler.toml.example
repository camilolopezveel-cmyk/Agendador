# D1 Database Binding
# -------------------
# To connect your Astro application to a Cloudflare D1 database,
# you need to create a "binding" here. A binding is a link
# that allows your code to access a Cloudflare resource.
#
# 1. 'binding' field: This is the name your code will use to
#    access the database. In our Astro API route
#    (src/pages/api/book.ts), we use `locals.runtime.env.D1_DB`,
#    so the binding name MUST be "D1_DB".
#
# 2. 'database_name' field: This is the name of your D1 database
#    as it appears in your Cloudflare dashboard.
#
# 3. 'database_id' field: This is the unique ID of your D1 database.
#    You can find this in your Cloudflare dashboard or by using
#    the `wrangler d1 list` command.

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "D1_DB" # Must match the name used in your Astro code
database_name = "your-database-name"
database_id = "your-database-id"
